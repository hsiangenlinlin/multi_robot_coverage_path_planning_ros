# multi_robot_coverage_path_planning_ros
A ROS-based project implementing multi-robot coverage path planning in a Stage environment. The robots navigate through obstacles using motion planning, communicate their movements via custom messages, and reset to initial positions. The project includes Python nodes for each step and utilizes ROS Stage for execution.
